# hello-world
Learning the basics of coding.  My main focus will be on learning to code in CPython.
I'm just learning for work to  be more productive.  I'm trying to learn the basics of automating large pulls of data though web services adn formatting/conditioning the data so it can be easily worked with.  The end goal is to automate metrics so that trends/anomalies can be seen.  Also, the goal is to allow users through Kibana or another data visualization tool the ability to explore the data themselves to meet their individual needs.
